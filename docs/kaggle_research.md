Kaggle Research
===============
Out fo the three classes of problems, PV mapping fits into the 
[Research Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/about/host/research) category.

Kaggle only hosts 5 pro-bono research competitions a year and requires a proposal to be submitted.

Requirements
-----------
Non-profit is fine, need legal authorisation to release dataset publicly, need cash prize and solutions need to be open-sourced

To be selected, project needs to be:
* A good fit: clearly structured supervised learning problem, ample data
* Feasible: Is is logistically possible to make data available, can host organisation facilitate competition
* Impact: Scope of problem, how impactful is open source solution.

What is else is needed?
----------------------
* Structure: e.g. separate validation and evaluation stages?
* Metrics:
    * Average precision: area under the precision-recall curve obtained by sampling precision and recall at discrete recall values. Since project is not localisation sensitive this is probably ok
* Truth: From OpenStreetMap? from FiT dataset?
* Different classes: e.g. solar farm vs residential.
* submission file: csv file with bounding box co-ordinates of each panel in EPSG:27700, in format of shape file?
* Use of external data? e.g. ordnance survey open map data (e.g. building outlines), society data, other satellite data?


What is needed from us?
----------------------
* Exploratory notebook
* Example baseline model
* Example submission file
* Code for calculating metrics from submissions

My history
----------
PhD in astronomy, where I applied some simple machine learning techniques ot extragalactic data, but also carreid
 out interdisciplinary projects:
some in medical field, groundwork leading to successful change detection grant. 4 years as project scientist for EU 
funded project, where also applied prob. programming to extragalatic data.

After that, decided to persue the interscisplanry work in commercial sector, first as part of uni, then as spin out. 
Carried out numerous projects, e.g. bayesiaon opimtisaiion for Ambiental,
Models for customer-product interactions, sensor fusion, vertical farming. 

Covid has completely disrupted business and cannot see consultancy being popular for a while, currently assessing 
options, e.g. back in academia

Energy fanatic, e.g. fully charged, my own moixa-battery and panels, octopus agile tariff. Keen to help out if useful
